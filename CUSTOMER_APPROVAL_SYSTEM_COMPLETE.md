# Customer Approval System - Complete Implementation âœ…

## Overview
The customer approval system has been **fully implemented** and is working correctly. New customer registrations now require approval by a cashier or admin before the account becomes active.

## System Components

### Backend Implementation âœ…
- **Database Migration**: Added approval tracking fields to users table
- **Registration Logic**: New customers are created with `status = 'pending'`
- **Login Protection**: Pending/rejected customers cannot login
- **Approval Endpoints**: Full API for cashiers/admins to manage approvals

### Frontend Implementation âœ…
- **Customer Approval Page**: New page at `/customer-approval` for cashiers/admins
- **Navigation Menu**: Added "Customer Approval" menu item for authorized roles
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface with real-time updates

## How It Works

### 1. Customer Registration
```
Customer registers â†’ Account created with status="pending" â†’ 
User receives message: "Your account is pending approval"
```

### 2. Login Attempt (Before Approval)
```
Customer tries to login â†’ System blocks login â†’ 
Error: "Your account is pending approval"
```

### 3. Cashier/Admin Approval Process
```
Cashier logs in â†’ Navigates to "Customer Approval" â†’ 
Views pending customers â†’ Clicks "Approve" or "Reject" â†’ 
Database updated â†’ Customer can now login
```

### 4. Customer Login (After Approval)
```
Customer tries to login â†’ System allows login â†’ 
Success: Customer can access their account
```

## API Endpoints

### Customer Registration
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Creates pending customer account

### Customer Login
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Blocks pending/rejected customers

### Approval Management (Cashier/Admin Only)
- `GET /api/auth/pending-users` - Get list of pending customers
- `POST /api/auth/approve-user/:userId` - Approve a customer
- `POST /api/auth/reject-user/:userId` - Reject a customer with reason

## Frontend Routes

- `/customer-approval` - Customer approval management page (Cashier/Admin only)
- Protected by role-based access control

## Database Schema

### Users Table (Updated)
```sql
-- Existing fields + new approval fields:
approved_by INTEGER NULL,           -- ID of cashier/admin who approved
approved_at TIMESTAMP NULL,         -- When approval happened  
rejected_by INTEGER NULL,           -- ID of cashier/admin who rejected
rejected_at TIMESTAMP NULL,         -- When rejection happened
rejection_reason TEXT NULL          -- Reason for rejection
```

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing via Browser

1. **Open Frontend**: http://localhost:5174
2. **Register New Customer**: 
   - Click "Register" 
   - Fill form and submit
   - See message: "Account pending approval"

3. **Try Customer Login**: 
   - Should fail with "pending approval" message

4. **Login as Cashier/Admin**:
   - Email: `admin@toolink.com` / Password: `admin123`
   - Or: `cashier@toolink.com` / Password: `password123`

5. **Access Customer Approval**:
   - Click "Customer Approval" in sidebar
   - View pending customers

### Current Database Status

From previous migration, we have:
- Pending customers: `nirmalisuranga4210@gmail.com`
- Active cashier: `cashier@toolink.com`

## Security Features

- **Audit Trail**: All approvals/rejections are logged with timestamp and approver ID
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks during login
