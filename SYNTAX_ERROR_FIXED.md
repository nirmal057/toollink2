# Issue Resolution - Syntax Error Fixed

## Problem Identified
The application was not working due to a **JSX syntax error** in the LandingPage.tsx file.

**Error Message:**
```
Unexpected token, expected "," (147:15)
C:\Users\Laptop Island\Desktop\Chivantha\project 2\ToolLink\src\pages\LandingPage.tsx: Unexpected token, expected "," (147:15)
```

## Root Cause
During the previous edits to enhance the navigation hover effects, a JSX formatting issue was introduced:
- Missing proper line breaks between JSX elements
- Improper spacing around closing tags
- Malformed JSX structure causing React/Babel parser to fail

## Solution Applied
Fixed the JSX syntax issues:

1. **Fixed missing line break:**
   ```tsx
   // BEFORE (Broken):
   transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}                  />
   
   // AFTER (Fixed):
   transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
   />
   ```

2. **Corrected JSX structure:**
   ```tsx
   // BEFORE (Broken):
   </motion.a>
   ))}
   </motion.div>            {/* Auth Buttons */}
   
   // AFTER (Fixed):
   </motion.a>
   ))}
   </motion.div>
   
   {/* Auth Buttons */}
   ```

## Status After Fix
✅ **Application Status:** WORKING
✅ **Frontend URL:** http://localhost:5173
✅ **Navigation Functions:** Working properly
✅ **Button Hover Effects:** All functioning
✅ **No Build Errors:** Clean compilation
✅ **JSX Syntax:** Valid and properly formatted
