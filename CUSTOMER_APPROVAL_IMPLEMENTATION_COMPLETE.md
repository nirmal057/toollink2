# ✅ Customer Registration with Approval Workflow - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 🎯 Summary
Successfully implemented a complete customer registration and approval workflow for the ToolLink system where:

1. **New customers register** but require approval before accessing the system
2. **Admin/Cashier users** can approve or reject customer registrations
3. **Approved customers** gain full access to the customer portal
4. **Rejected customers** are removed from the system with notification

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Backend Changes Made:

1. **Modified Registration Logic** (`src/routes/auth.js`):
   - Changed `isApproved: false` for customer role
   - Added `requiresApproval` flag in registration response
   - Enhanced registration response messages

2. **Added New Approval Endpoints**:
   ```javascript
   GET  /api/auth/pending-users     // Get pending customers (Admin/Cashier only)
   POST /api/auth/approve-user      // Approve customer (Admin/Cashier only)
   POST /api/auth/reject-user       // Reject customer (Admin/Cashier only)
   ```

3. **Enhanced Login Validation**:
   - Added check for `isApproved` status
   - Returns specific error for pending approval accounts

4. **Fixed ES Module Issues**:
   - Updated crypto imports in User model
   - Resolved authentication middleware imports

### Frontend Integration:

1. **Registration Component** (`src/pages/Auth/Register.tsx`):
   - Already handles approval workflow messaging
   - Shows appropriate success messages for pending approval

2. **Customer Approval Page** (`src/pages/CustomerApproval.tsx`):
   - Uses the new approval endpoints
   - Provides admin interface for approval management

3. **API Configuration** (`src/config/api.ts`):
   - Already includes all necessary approval endpoints
